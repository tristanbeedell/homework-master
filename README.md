# homework-master

This is [a website](https://www.homework-master.co.uk/) that is connected to discord. It will allow users to sign up and be given roles, giving them access to text chats with all the people in their clases at school.

It is written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

It uses [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) to connect to discord, and [express](https://expressjs.com/) to serve the webpage.

This is being hosted on my raspberry pi.
