				<p>You should have been given a group pin for your school. Go to <a href="/join">Join</a> and select the name of your school and enter the pin. You will then be given an invite link to discord.</p>
				<p>When in discord, (after making an account or signing in) there should be a 'discord server' listed along the left side of the page. You will also have recieved a message from our trusty discord bot, <span class="mention">@Homework Master</span>. After giving the pin you will be sent a link where you can sign up to this site, and then you may pick which classes you are in.</p>
				<p>Upon returning to discord, click on the server. You will notice the channels along the side have been added, one for each class. Go and say hello!</p>

				<p>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a> is a messaging service. It allows for large groups of people to gather in a 'discord server', containing many channels. The Homework Master will create a channel for each class you are in in school, and anyone else that is in that class can also see and speak in that channel. Discord is very easy to use, and  is on Android, iOS, desktop, and will even run in your browser (No download required).
				</p>
				<p>Different people have different permissions in a discord server. Admins can do what they like, so they can be trusted and you can turn to an admin in the server for problems.
